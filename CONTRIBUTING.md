## Issue Management

### Assignment Process
- **First-Come, First-Served**: Issues are assigned to the first person who comments requesting assignment.
- **Work Only on Assigned Issues**: You may only work on issues assigned to you. PRs for unassigned issues will not be accepted or merged.
- **One Issue at a Time**: To request a new issue assignment, your current assigned issue's PR must be at least approved (merged or not).

### Activity Requirements
- **Stay Active**: Maintain regular progress on your assigned issues.
- **3-Day Inactivity Rule**: Issues inactive for 3 days after assignment will be marked as stale.
- **Reassignment**: After being marked stale, you have an additional 12 hours to resume work. After this grace period, the issue will be reassigned to another contributor.

### Need More Time?
If you need an extension, notify the maintainer before your issue is marked stale to avoid reassignment. We understand that life happens and are happy to accommodate reasonable requests.

## Pull Request Management

### Before Submitting
- **Stay in Sync**: Ensure your PR is up-to-date with the latest changes from the **main** branch. Regularly run `git pull` and `rebase` to incorporate upstream changes.
- **Test Your Changes**: Verify that all tests pass and your code compiles without warnings.

### PR Requirements
Your pull request must include:
- A clear description of your changes
- The issue number it addresses
- Adherence to project coding standards
- Necessary documentation updates
- Test cases for new features or bug fixes
- Meaningful commit messages

### Activity Requirements
- **Stay Active**: Respond to review comments and make requested changes promptly.
- **3-Day Inactivity Rule**: PRs inactive for 3 days will be marked as stale.
- **Closure**: After being marked stale, you have an additional 12 hours to resume activity. After this grace period, the PR will be closed and the corresponding issue will be unassigned.

## Additional Guidelines

### Communication
- **Ask Questions**: Use GitHub Discussions or Discord to seek clarification or discuss ideas.
- **Discuss Major Changes**: For significant features or architectural changes, discuss your approach with maintainers before starting work to ensure alignment and avoid duplicated efforts.
- **Update Proactively**: Communicate any challenges or delays you encounter.

### Collaboration
- **Participate in Reviews**: Review other contributors' PRs when possible. Constructive feedback strengthens the project and fosters collaboration.
- **Be Respectful**: Treat all contributors with respect and professionalism.

## Coding Guidelines

### Modern C++ Best Practices
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Avoid raw pointers where possible; prefer smart pointers
- Use STL containers effectively

### Code Quality
- **Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Code Formatting**: Maintain consistent indentation (4 spaces per level recommended).
- **Documentation**: Document all public-facing methods using comments or Doxygen docstrings.
- **Zero Warnings**: Ensure code compiles without warnings.
- **Testing**: Verify all tests pass before submitting a PR.
