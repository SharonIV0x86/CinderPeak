## **The CinderPeak API**

### **Library Headers**

CinderPeak's public API is modular, with components split into separate headers. The table below highlights the key ones.

| Header File | Key Classes/Structures | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CinderPeak.hpp | (Convenience Header) | Includes all necessary public headers for basic use. This should be your default choice. |
| CinderGraph.hpp | CinderGraph | The concrete implementation of a graph using an adjacency list data structure. |
| PeakStore.hpp | PeakStore | Core storage engine that manages graph data internally. |
| StorageEngine/Utils.hpp | GraphCreationOptions, CinderVertex, CinderEdge | Contains utility functions, graph creation options, and base classes for custom types. |

## **How to Include Header Files**

### CinderPeak.hpp
To use CinderPeak, you need only to include this header file along with the required namespace declarations.

```cpp
#include "CinderPeak.hpp"
using namespace CinderPeak::PeakStore;
using namespace CinderPeak;
```

**Purpose and Importance:**  
This main public API header serves as a single entry point, bundling all library components. It simplifies setup by removing the need for multiple includes. While the core logic is in /src, you'll mostly interact with this header.

### Individual Headers (Advanced Usage)

If you want to include specific components only:

```cpp
#include "CinderGraph.hpp"    // For adjacency list graphs
#include "StorageEngine/Utils.hpp"  // For utility functions and options
```

**Purpose and Importance:**  
- `CinderGraph.hpp`: Adjacency list implementation. Efficient for sparse graphs, supports directed/undirected edges, allows dynamic updates, and suits DFS/BFS/shortest paths
- `StorageEngine/Utils.hpp`: Provides common utilities for the library, including type checks, graph creation options, metadata, and constants

---

## **Core Classes and Structures**

CinderPeak's architecture is built on a few key components that you'll interact with regularly. It is designed around a small set of key classes that define how graphs are represented, created, and manipulated.

| Class / Structure | Header Location | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CinderGraph | src/CinderGraph.hpp | An adjacency list implementation of a graph. Efficient for sparse graphs. |
| PeakStore | src/PeakStore.hpp | Core storage engine that handles the internal graph data management. |
| GraphCreationOptions | src/StorageEngine/Utils.hpp | Configuration class that defines how a graph should behave (Directed, Weighted, etc.). |
| CinderVertex | src/StorageEngine/Utils.hpp | Base class for custom vertex types. |
| CinderEdge | src/StorageEngine/Utils.hpp | Base class for custom edge types. |


### **CinderGraph**
- Implements adjacency list representation
- Best for sparse graphs or when graphs are frequently updated
- Efficient for traversals like BFS/DFS
- Direct instantiation: `CinderGraph<VertexType, EdgeType> graph(options)`

### **PeakStore**
- Manages internal storage of graph data, ensuring efficient data handling across graph types.
- Typically used internally but essential for understanding the libraryâ€™s architecture.

### **GraphCreationOptions**
Defines how a graph should behave (Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted). Available options include:
- `GraphCreationOptions::Directed`
- `GraphCreationOptions::Undirected`
- `GraphCreationOptions::Weighted`
- `GraphCreationOptions::Unweighted`
- `GraphCreationOptions::SelfLoops`
- `GraphCreationOptions::ParallelEdges`

### **CinderVertex and CinderEdge**
Base classes that custom vertex and edge types must inherit from. They provide:
- Unique ID generation
- Name generation
- Comparison operators
- Hash support for use in containers

---

## **Using Custom Data Types**

CinderPeak is a fully templated library, which means you can define your own struct or class for vertex and edge data. However, custom types must inherit from the provided base classes.

**Example: Defining Custom Classes for a Social Network**

```cpp
#include <string>
#include "CinderPeak.hpp"
using namespace CinderPeak::PeakStore;
using namespace CinderPeak;

// A custom class to hold data for each person (vertex)
class UserProfile : public CinderVertex {
public:
    std::string username;
    int age;
    
    UserProfile() {}
    UserProfile(const std::string& name, int userAge) : username(name), age(userAge) {}
};

// A custom class to hold data for each friendship (edge)
class Friendship : public CinderEdge {
public:
    int year_met;
    std::string relationship_type; // e.g., "Family", "Work"
    
    Friendship() {}
    Friendship(int year, const std::string& type) : year_met(year), relationship_type(type) {}
};
```

## **Basic Usage: Code Examples**

Here are practical, step-by-step examples showing how to use the library's core functionality.

### **Example 1: Creating a Simple Integer Graph**

This example shows how to create a basic directed, weighted graph storing integers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "CinderPeak.hpp"
using namespace CinderPeak::PeakStore;
using namespace CinderPeak;

int main() {
    // Create graph creation options
    GraphCreationOptions opts({
        GraphCreationOptions::Directed,
        GraphCreationOptions::Weighted
    });

    // Create a graph that stores integers for both vertices and edges
    CinderGraph<int, int> graph(opts);

    // Add vertices to the graph
    graph.addVertex(10);
    graph.addVertex(20);
    graph.addVertex(30);

    // Add weighted edges to connect the vertices
    graph.addEdge(10, 20, 5);   // Edge from 10 to 20 with weight 5
    graph.addEdge(20, 30, 10);  // Edge from 20 to 30 with weight 10

    // Access edge weights using operator[]
    std::cout << "Edge weight from 10 to 20: " << graph[10][20] << std::endl;
    
    // Or using getEdge method
    int edgeWeight = graph.getEdge(20, 30);
    std::cout << "Edge weight from 20 to 30: " << edgeWeight << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Example 2: Using Custom Data Types**

This example uses the UserProfile and Friendship classes defined earlier to create a directed social network graph.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include "CinderPeak.hpp"
using namespace CinderPeak::PeakStore;
using namespace CinderPeak;

// Custom classes (defined as shown in previous section)
class UserProfile : public CinderVertex {
public:
    std::string username;
    int age;
    UserProfile() {}
    UserProfile(const std::string& name, int userAge) : username(name), age(userAge) {}
};

class Friendship : public CinderEdge {
public:
    int year_met;
    std::string relationship_type;
    Friendship() {}
    Friendship(int year, const std::string& type) : year_met(year), relationship_type(type) {}
};

int main() {
    // Create a directed, weighted graph with custom types
    GraphCreationOptions opts({
        GraphCreationOptions::Directed,
        GraphCreationOptions::Weighted
    });
    
    CinderGraph<UserProfile, Friendship> socialGraph(opts);

    // Create user profiles
    UserProfile alice("Alice", 30);
    UserProfile bob("Bob", 25);
    UserProfile charlie("Charlie", 35);

    // Add vertices to the graph
    socialGraph.addVertex(alice);
    socialGraph.addVertex(bob);
    socialGraph.addVertex(charlie);

    // Create friendship connections
    Friendship workFriend(2022, "Work");
    Friendship familyMember(2020, "Family");

    // Add edges with friendship data
    socialGraph.addEdge(alice, bob, workFriend);
    socialGraph.addEdge(alice, charlie, familyMember);

    // Access edge data
    Friendship connection = socialGraph.getEdge(alice, bob);
    std::cout << "Alice and Bob met in: " << connection.year_met << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Relationship type: " << connection.relationship_type << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Example 3: Using CinderGraph for Sparse Graphs**

This example demonstrates using the adjacency list representation for a sparse graph.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "CinderPeak.hpp"
using namespace CinderPeak::PeakStore;
using namespace CinderPeak;

int main() {
    // Create options for an undirected, weighted graph
    GraphCreationOptions opts({
        GraphCreationOptions::Undirected,
        GraphCreationOptions::Weighted
    });

    // Use CinderGraph for sparse graphs
    CinderGraph<int, double> network(opts);

    // Add vertices
    network.addVertex(1);
    network.addVertex(2);
    network.addVertex(3);
    network.addVertex(4);
    network.addVertex(5);

    // Add weighted edges (distances)
    network.addEdge(1, 3, 10.5);
    network.addEdge(1, 4, 9.2);
    network.addEdge(4, 5, 7.8);
    network.addEdge(1, 2, 6.1);

    std::cout << "Successfully created a sparse network graph!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

## **Graph Creation Options**

When creating graphs, you can specify various options that control the graph's behavior:

```cpp
// Directed, weighted graph
GraphCreationOptions opts1({
    GraphCreationOptions::Directed,
    GraphCreationOptions::Weighted
});

// Undirected, unweighted graph with self-loops allowed
GraphCreationOptions opts2({
    GraphCreationOptions::Undirected,
    GraphCreationOptions::Unweighted,
    GraphCreationOptions::SelfLoops
});

// Directed graph with parallel edges allowed
GraphCreationOptions opts3({
    GraphCreationOptions::Directed,
    GraphCreationOptions::ParallelEdges
});
```

### **Available Options:**

| Option | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| `Directed` | Creates a directed graph where edges have direction |
| `Undirected` | Creates an undirected graph where edges are bidirectional |
| `Weighted` | Graph supports edge weights |
| `Unweighted` | Graph doesn't use edge weights |
| `SelfLoops` | Vertices can have edges to themselves |
| `ParallelEdges` | Multiple edges between the same pair of vertices are allowed |

---

## **Core Operations**

### **Adding Elements**

```cpp
// Add vertices
graph.addVertex(data);

// Add unweighted edges (for unweighted graphs)
graph.addEdge(source, destination);

// Add weighted edges (for weighted graphs)
graph.addEdge(source, destination, weight);
```

### **Accessing Edge Data**

```cpp
EdgeType weight = graph.getEdge(source, destination);
```

---

**Guidelines:**
- Use `CinderGraph` for most common applications, especially when you have many vertices but relatively few edges

---

## **Error Handling**

CinderPeak uses an internal error handling system. When operations fail, they are logged internally:

- Adding duplicate vertices (when parallel edges aren't allowed) will log a warning but won't crash
- Accessing non-existent edges returns a default-constructed EdgeType
- Most errors are handled gracefully with appropriate logging

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Always include required namespaces:**
   ```cpp
   using namespace CinderPeak::PeakStore;
   using namespace CinderPeak;
   ```

2. **Choose the right graph representation:**
   - Use `CinderGraph` for sparse graphs
   - Use `CinderGraph` for dense graphs or when you need O(1) edge lookups

3. **Custom types must inherit from base classes:**
   ```cpp
   class MyVertex : public CinderVertex { /* ... */ };
   class MyEdge : public CinderEdge { /* ... */ };
   ```

4. **Configure graph options appropriately:**
   ```cpp
   GraphCreationOptions opts({
       GraphCreationOptions::Directed,    // or Undirected
       GraphCreationOptions::Weighted     // or Unweighted
   });
   ```

5. **Use consistent data types:**
   - Make sure your vertex and edge types are consistent throughout your application
   - Consider using primitive types (int, double, string) for simple cases
