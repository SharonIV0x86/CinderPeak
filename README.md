## Key Features
- **Flexible Graph Representations** - Supports adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, and hybrid CSR/COO formats for efficient storage.
- **Customizable & Templated** - Fully templated design allows you to define custom vertex and edge types.
- **Thread Safety** - Designed to work seamlessly in multi-threaded applications.
- **High Performance** - Leverages modern C++ features like smart pointers and STL containers for optimized execution.
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Built with Google Test (GTest) to ensure reliability and robustness.
- **Extensive Documentation** - Detailed usage guides, examples, and API references are hosted with Docusaurus.

# Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "CinderPeak.hpp"
using namespace CinderPeak;

// Custom vertex/edge types
struct MyVertex : CinderPeak::CinderVertex {
  int id;
  MyVertex(int id) : id(id) {}
};
struct MyEdge : CinderPeak::CinderEdge {
  float w;
  MyEdge(float w) : w(w) {}
};

int main() {
  // --- Complex Graph (custom vertex + weighted edge) ---
  GraphCreationOptions optsU({GraphCreationOptions::Undirected});
  PolicyConfiguration cfg(PolicyConfiguration::Throw,
                          PolicyConfiguration::Silent);

  CinderGraph<MyVertex, MyEdge> customGraph(optsU, cfg);

  MyVertex v1(1);
  MyVertex v2(2);
  
  MyEdge e1(0.5f);
  MyEdge e2(0.8f);

  customGraph.addVertex(v1);
  customGraph.addVertex(v2);
  customGraph.addEdge(v1, v2, e1);
  customGraph.updateEdge(v1, v2, e2);

  // --- Simple Weighted Graph (int vertices/edges) ---
  GraphCreationOptions optsD({GraphCreationOptions::Directed});
  PolicyConfiguration cfg(PolicyConfiguration::Throw,
                          PolicyConfiguration::LogConsole);

  CinderGraph<int, int> intGraph(optsD);

  intGraph.addVertex(1);
  intGraph.addVertex(2);
  intGraph.addEdge(1, 2, 10);
  intGraph.updateEdge(1, 2, 20);

  std::cout << "Vertices: " << intGraph.numVertices()
            << ", Edges: " << intGraph.numEdges() << "\n";

  // --- Unweighted Graph ---
  CinderGraph<int, Unweighted> unweighted(optsD);
  unweighted.addVertex(1);
  unweighted.addVertex(2);
  unweighted.addEdge(1, 2);
}
```
